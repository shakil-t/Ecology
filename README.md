# Ecology
This repository contains my research in the course Ecology in 2020. Apart from computer science, reading about ecology has always been one of my interests, and due to rapid environmental crises such as climate change, it has become a topic about which I read often. Hence, in early 2020, I got the chance to register for this course during my bachelor studies with the prominent [Samaneh Karbalaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BdB0crQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&citft=2&citft=3&email_for_op=tayefehshakila%40gmail.com&gmla=AJsN-F5IYlu24MK8Z5GsKZIz73ss5CODV3bf33rUkrNH5tclx9Qmq_9v3Yl28zIwXDMfZAi6_O_ba90VAmTNztxKjKmei93WtEYtK8Q-llkS0YkOWK8jSsKv0hwkzs1ezGgdnYH7Fp25szVbj_LQFNVo5vsrBcI07SoJU-o7Eh9qdm6Pr5OxA2pIAM89w0bakK4YFcagt3iEWX-sfq5SuKv3o0yGMlGaFOj0aQbAPubOAcHB8flbIgC-ZTpGaBfq49Z5Wjwzcyv_z4RpQ_tQeaz8T0KntI1sLN7BVIQhOKvrz4LHwaJ2e2hqJbs_t3wxqSS7H0tErv0Pkk1-8GK0ccANFkddl8Rllw) as the lecturer. At first, my goal was to focus my research on noise blocking/absorbing plants, however after the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, I shifted the focus on the negative and positive impacts it had on the environment.\
This [paper]() contains my report on the observations I explored into this matter. Moreover, some of my other reports for this course are available which may hopefully increase awareness of this issue.
